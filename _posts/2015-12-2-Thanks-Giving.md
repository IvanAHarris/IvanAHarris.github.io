title: First Fix Sink
---
I completely wrecked my brother's sink during this past week, and I made my best attempt to install a new sink.  In order to be accurate I should state that the porcelain wall mount was perfectly intact so I just needed to replace the faucet, supply lines, valves, and eventually the J-pipe but that was not my fault.

My brother and sister who I love immensely still live in my hometown Chicago, and my daughter loves her cousins so when we make the trip together to Chicago we have the possibility of having a great time.  This trip was one of the best.  While my daughter was playing with her cousins I was busy trying to fix a leaking sink at my brother's house while he was at work.  I thought it would be so easy to fix, I would grab a flat head and tighted the knobs on the faucet.  Strip the screws horribly, and the faucet would not stop providing water; Bad Idea.

So I left my brother's house.  Important errand - Seriously.

When I returned my brother engaged me at the door with a simple, "What the fuck did you do? Fix the sink!"

I planned on doing it so he was not telling me what to do.  I do what I want, he is such a jerk, why was the sink dripping anyway Because he is lazy I was trying to make it better.  I am always fixing his problems he should be happy I am solving another one of his problems.  Fine, Fine, maybe this was my fault but still...whatever.

Three hours pass as I banter with my brother about the merits of stuff, called each other fucker/fuck-o, visited Subway, peed in the alley (water was shut off remember), and fiddled with a faucet.  My sister could have fixed that sink but she was not making the drive.  Fuck.

Finally we decided I would just take the faucet apart and we would replace it in the morning.  Excellent idea Johnny, I told my brother, seven years my senior, to pull the sink up as far as he possible and out towards himself.  

He ripped the sink off the wall mount snapping the J-pipe and sending me into hysterical laughter.  Lou Fucking Ferrigno was so pissed about his sink until then at 3am he just had to smile and laugh.

We slept.  I woke up around 630am and made my way to Home Depot.  For $50 I finally put things right.
