title: Awkward Bus Ride
---

A few days ago in the bus I had an interesting interaction with two ladies older than I.

So before I enter a bus heading somewhere to do something, I do things on occasion, a woman in line for the bus decides to speak to me.  She has blonde and silver hair, not blended colors really, more like streaks of dirty blonde and silver-gray.  I notice her teeth are the same color of her hair when she asks, 

"How old is your baby?"

I answer, "Four months".  Simple.  

I like to think I do not need new friends unless I choose them.  She prods alittle more and says, 

"Oh so tiny", 

more than four times in a quick chipmunk-ie voice.  

Let me tell you insulting my children is not a way to my heart or mind.  At this point she steps out of our two person line and mills about until the bus driver opens the door to the bus.  The driver was starting the route so me and Silver Top are the first two people on an empty bus.  So her name is Silver Top now.

I stroll to a seat badly needing to take a rest.  I do not own a car or a stroller when I travel I carry my four month old in an ergo baby carrier.  I hop on this idle bus ready to sit for at least ten minutes, unstrap my maroon ergo and cradle the baby in order to keep her awake.  Unsurprisingly, Silver Top sits directly behind me; out of the 20-plus empty seats she chose the seat behind the guy with the four month old baby.  Maybe she does not fly often enough to know the dangers of that choice.

So eventually she asks, 
"Boy or Girl, she's gorgeous, look at those eyes."

I response, "Yes, she is gorgeous.  That is how we planned it."

I tell you man platitudes and well-wishes all bullshit - if you guess the sex after asking it kind of defeats the... you know what, forget it I am just a jerk for not being friendly.

Five minutes into the ride and Miss Obvious enters the bus.  She is 60-plus years old and dressed to please Macklemore.  Lime green, white, and sky blue windbreaker, rainbow colored knitted hat, and a witch's cauldron of a handbag coupled with a yellow umbrella.  She lumbers on the bus waving to Silver Top, I assume she is waving to Silver Top who is still sitting behind me.

Miss Obvious stops waving to steady herself in the bus and then as she walks she waves again with her right hand in front of face.  Not a sound or any indication of motion behind me.  Miss Obvious waves again, full hand, wrist, elbow swaying, with a grin begging for acknowledgement.  Nothing coming from behind me.

Miss Obvious approaches a seat adjacent to mine, and with full swing of her cauldron bag rids herself of that weight.  She turns in less than a millisecond to me and looks at my cradled baby and crackles, 
![I need a closer look](http://inthepowderroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Old-Lady-Holes-In-the-Powder-Room.jpg "Is that your baby?")

"Is that you baby?"
							
I reply, "Is that your coat?"

"What? So cute. Is that your baby?"

"Is that your coat?"

She then reaches out with her black gloved hand and says, "Well their so cute, is that yours?"

I push her hand away and I warn her, "Don't touch.  Take a seat."

"But that baby is white."

I finally get to use my new line.  I have been thinking what I would say if someone asked if this was my baby and finally I had a chance to use it on someone.

I reply, "Is that your coat?  Possession is nine-tenths of the law."

Miss Obvious glanced at my eyes for the first time in our encounter, and promptly moves her large bag and umbrella and sits her ass in the seat across the aisle from me.

As she seats herself, verbally comtemplating the weather and if the forecast called for rain Silver Top decides to speak to me.

Silver Top completely out of my sight is probably three inches from right ear and says something that made me write this post.

In a half whisper and full congratulatory tone she says, "She allowed her children to be molested watch out for her."

Silver Top then moves from her current seat to a seat about five seats behind Miss Obvious.

Miss Obvious greets Silver Top and receives the terse response, "Don't Talk to Me." 

Are you thinking - **WTF!  WHAT!  HOW does she know...why are they...whatever.  WTF-ever.**

I wish I could just wear Silver Top's response sometimes, and that day I really needed that response on my shirt.
