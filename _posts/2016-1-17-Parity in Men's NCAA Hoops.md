title: No parity no degree
---

Parity.  Statistics.  Words, words with convoluted meanings.  I am fond of using the correct word because I often fail to do just that; I have horrible embarrassing stories of using the wrong word in a sentence only to be corrected by someone kind enough to correct me.

Parity: the state or condition of being equal, especially regarding status or pay.	
*New Oxford American Dictionary*

I told a friend I believe that the NCAA Men's Basketball has decreased its parity, or its equality of team strength, (say this in a southern, Colonel Sanders style voice) since the NBA enacted a rule that, high or low, impresses upon hopeful members of this fine association a requirement to attend an institution of higher learning for no less than 1 year; that is the low of it (now go get some greens and sweet tea). 	

I think (or hypothesized at the time) that all the players like Lebron James, Amare Stoudemire, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, I will stop the list here, skipping the university experience allowed teams that would have recruited them to slip into a normalcy without these super-athletes in their starting lineup.  So how do I know if I on to something or just talking out my ass?  How, oh how do I answer this question?  Quickly. I must use the smart man's lie detector, statistics.

Statistics: the practice or science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.

So I searched Google and found -competitive balance- [Encyclopedia of Sport Management and Marketing](https://books.google.com/books?id=gDp1AwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1831&ots=eeHxp3DgAK&dq=ncaa%20relative%20standard%20deviation&pg=PA256#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [an article about parity](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/?p=12728) which led me to another article [about parity range](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43088/1/MPRA_paper_43088.pdf).  So I did some searching on EBSCOHOST and LexisNexus and scratched my balls while thinking. I think margin of victory is important because the game of basketball provides more opportunities to score and the scoring is varied with free throws as one point, two pointers, and long range three pointers.  A better team will not only win the game, they will win a game by large margin because they are not shooting with luck on their side, they are shooting with skill; flip side they will defend their basket well causing their opponent to shoot a percentage much less than luck or chance.  So they should score consistently and cause others to not score, consistently.  Parity measurements have to include these factors and many others ... Alas, I gave myself a week to complete this little project so I chose to only focus on one established method for assessing parity and not try to write a thesis on this because that is a real possibility with all the possible variables to consider.  

I decided to use the idealized standard deviation to find a parity range using that year's mean winning percentage.  In other words out of like 300 teams were there a lot, like 50 - 60%, of the teams winning 50%, better yet between +-1 idealized standard deviation from the mean, of their games, if so; **this could** signs of true love and or parity.  That may not the best explanation but I hope makes it a little bit clearer.  

Now that I am writing this I am bored, I am bored writing about my own experience.  There were some cool steps in this process; reading about relative standard deviation and competitive balance, grabbing data from [Sports Reference](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/) (a great site for sports fans), re-reading about idealized standard deviation and parity, converting CSV into SQL instructions (just for skill-building), using Excel to perform all the calculations, part of this process was completed while watching football and old Project Runway episodes on my second monitor.  

I am a little pissed I gave myself this deadline of one week because there are so many ways to analyze this data and really dive into this parity question and I think I am just scratching the surface.  Well maybe next time I make this more exciting and explain more about the calculations and my work flow.  There is always next time.

And a poem, of sorts,

>The players so great	
>Never stay too late	
>No reasons to wait	
>When money could make
