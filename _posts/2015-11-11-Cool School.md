title: Trademark bad!  Trademark Good!

Tangram is great puzzler.  My daughter loves her new gift and plays with her calendar tangram puzzles almost everyday.  So, a few days ago during an unscheduled visit to my daughters class I patted myself on-the-back for marrying the right person.  My wife chose the school, and then I met with the teacher because I am paranoid about my children.  It is the perfect school for my daughter, one activity reassured me.

I walked into the classroom without hesitation and asked, "Is it lunchtime?". I thought, 'it's noon, lunchtime, it's play time right?'.  In return, one my first born's amiable teachers posed a different question, "Do you want some?  There are leftovers."

How great is that!  Really great in my humble opinion.  So, to the interesting point, what the children were accomplishing.

All the students of this class were in a circle and for the next twenty minutes they discussed should shop owners have the right to trademark and should there be trademarks if already created in their class business project.  This class is a mixed age classroom with an age range from kindergarten to 6 grade, so for this build-your-business project (slogans, cute commercials via iMovie, flyers, pictures of products, etc) one older student started trademarking their items and telling other students they are infringing on his TM.  The teachers stated that the kids should explain the problem so a solution can be found. The kids described it some what like this, talking over each other like someone aske what do you want for Christmas:

"He said I could not sell a cat picture because he created a cat picture and trademarked it."  
"He said I could not sell a my picture of a giraffe mixed with a kangaroo because he drew a picture with a giraffe mixed with a kangaroo and trademarked."

To this kid's defense, it sounded like people were stealing other's ideas and he was just protecting his ideas, not poaching others then stamping a TM on it.  Also, this kid was damn clever, almost direct quote - "You guys with the 'Everything Store' need to stop creating those Yooses.  And your name is false advertising because your store does not have everything."  That last statement is throwing salt straight in their game, just a little f on top of the big U.

So the teachers shut that down real quick and set up a forum.  Literally.

They told one older kid to call on anyone raising their hand to speak on trademarks, and everyone should state if they want to allow trademarks, or not allow trademarks and why.  This worked, they self-policed so well that the teachers were able to leave the room to handle more urgent matters, and I watched as kids asked other kids to stop talking while others were talking.  My jaw probably dropped.  Here I am in the corner of the room, on the floor holding my three month old daughter watching kids discuss if trademarking makes sense for their fledgling economy.

Let me say there are about 25 kids in the class, and not all of them had something to say at all.  The most interesting comment came from the Boy Scout in the movie "UP", this boy is the flesh and blood inspiration, looks and personality, for that animated character.  His comment was something like: 
"I don't think you should be able to trademark stuff that exists.  Like if I create a picture of a lion head with a horse's butt and legs you, you, you shouldn't trademark that but but but if like I create a special magic spell or a special formula for something cool that does not exist already then then then I can trademark that because it is it is, it, it does not exist already and I created it out of thin air."

Sadly, the turmoil caused by trademarking was too much for the kids to tackle.  The kids shirked policy development and outlawed current trademarks and the ability to trademark.  

I thought this was a horrible miscalculation in the process.  It is a cop-out, it is refusing to handle a situation and instead avoid it until it becomes an even bigger problem.  People will steal ideas, and there should be a process, mechanism, tool to combat that theft.  

And you know what, and you know what... 

during dinner I shared my thoughts with my first born after she shared, with my wife and repeated to me, her statements made during the forum earlier that day.
