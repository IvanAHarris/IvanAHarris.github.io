Quit: stop or discontinue (an action or activity).*New Oxford American Dictionary*
Quitting is serious.  A quitter is like a loser, but worse because a quitter loses on purpose.

[Familiar words](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61QPcL8EpxL._SY355_.jpg)

Bobby Jindal quit, Kobe Bryant has not quit, President of the University of Missouri system did quit (forcibly!), Jon Stewart quit, Rolling Stones will never quit.  Still, quitting is a really hard thing (for some people) to do no matter the circumstances.

I recently listened to an [old freakonomics podcast](http://freakonomics.com/2014/05/29/the-upside-of-quitting-a-freakonomics-radio-rebroadcast/) and thought about quitting again.  So cognitive dissonances plays a huge role in the process of quitting; this process entails determining *what* should be 'quitted', *why* this should be 'quitted', *how* this should be 'quitted'.  So I think quitting is a repeated life choice like attending school;  attending school is always a good choice whose positive/negative attributes depend the *how* of your choice.  So you should feel comfortable choosing to quit and only stress about how you should quit.  At least that is the preach I try to practice.

Listening to the podcast brought up a question though, when is it really quitting?  Like does the activity or action have to be something you are invested in personally or does the activity or action have to be something you committed to complete. Now any use of resources (time, money, mental/emotional/physical energy) will influence your decision if you are **quitting** or just not doing something.  So I think **quitting** is person dependent and not resource dependent. 

So, you, you the reader, go to your nearest mall to buy some new shoes because you hate Zappos and online retailers in general for some reason, just follow me.  So you are at the mall with this plan of buying these pair of perfect shoes at this perfect price range and find that none of the stores have the shoes or if they do the shoes are well above(relative term because only you know what well above means for you) the perfect range.  So you travel an extra 20 miles to another set of stores only to find the same situation.  If you go home without shoes do you classify that as 'quitting'?  

Maybe that situation is super hard to handle for some people who can **never not** complete a task, while some one else has a much low threshold for quitting, 20 miles that ain't nothing.  I am probably a high threshold quitter and I think it is time for me to quit my year(s) long fascination with craps.

I toyed with, tweaked, modified this pet obsession for a long period of time.  I have tried to understand the game of craps, understand 'randomness' and probability and the physics of throwing solid cubes against felt.  I used it as a focus for working on my programming skills (Python, Javascript) [my lovely craps site](http://computerjunction.github.io/index.html) and building on my statistical skills so I developed some useful skills while trying to accomplish the impossible.  While I think this game can be beat because it was created by people and people are fallible so all their creations have faults, maybe the faults just aren't exploitable for profit.  With that said, I quit.
