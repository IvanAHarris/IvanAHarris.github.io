Quit: stop or discontinue (an action or activity). *New Oxford American Dictionary*

Bobby Jindal quit, Kobe Bryant has not quit, President of the University of Missouri system did quit (forcibly!), Jon Stewart quit, the Rolling Stones will never quit.

Quitting is serious.  A quitter is a derogatory term like loser, but probably worse because a quitter almost implies losing on purpose.

I recently listened to an [old freakonomics podcast](http://freakonomics.com/2014/05/29/the-upside-of-quitting-a-freakonomics-radio-rebroadcast/) and thought about quitting again.  So cognitive dissonance plays a huge role in the process of quitting; this process entails determining *what* should be 'quitted', *why* this should be 'quitted', *how* this should be 'quitted'.  So I think quitting is a regular life choice like the choice to learn something new; learning something new is always a proper, respectable choice whose positive/negative attributes depend on the *how* or implementation of your choice.  So you should feel comfortable choosing to quit and only stress about how you should quit.  At least that is the preach I try to practice.

Listening to the podcast brought up a question though, when is it quitting?  Retiring is not quitting, right?  Taking a break is definitely...not...quitting right?  Now any use of resources (time, money, mental/emotional/physical energy) will influence your decision to **quit**.  Sunk cost and opportunity cost might be measures associated with assessing the *what, why and how* of quitting but I am thinking more about is this a quit-able offense or just ceasing to continue.  I think **quitting** is person dependent and not resource dependent. 

So, you, you the reader, go to your nearest mall with this plan of buying this pair of perfect shoes at this perfect price range and find that none of the stores have the shoes or if they do the shoes are well above (relative term because only you know what well above means for you) the perfect range and you hate Zappos and online retailers in general for some reason, just follow me.  So you travel an extra 20 miles to another set of stores only to find the same situation.  If you go home without shoes do you classify that as a 'quit-able' offense?  

Maybe that situation is super hard to handle for some people who can **never not** complete a task, while some one else has a much higher threshold for quitting.  A high threshold person might not even contemplate a single word with a 'q' or 'u' or 't' when they did decide to go home without their perfect shoes within their perfect price range; 20 miles that ain't nothing, why even waste mental space thinking of a solution to a non-problem f'them shoes.  While a low threshold quitter starts shaking thinking about how much they hate going to sleep because it is a form quitting.  I hate to said it but I think I am a low threshold quitter, and I have something I really need to quit.

I toyed with, tweaked, modified this pet obsession for a long period of time.  I have tried to understand the game of craps, understand 'randomness' and probability and the physics of throwing solid cubes against felt.  I used it as a focus for working on my programming skills (Python, Javascript) [my lovely craps site](http://computerjunction.github.io/index.html) and building on my statistical skills so I developed some useful skills while trying to accomplish the impossible.  While I think this game can be beat because it was created by people and people are fallible so all their creations have faults. Maybe the faults, which have not found, just aren't exploitable for profit anyway.  So my practice that I preached is that I stressed over how do I quit this obsession. I thought: Should I publish the website with a domain name and ad space as a commemoration, should I make a trip to a casino and throw some bones, or should I keep this little itch and scratch it when I have free time?  No, I have decided I will just stop, no more tinkering, no more looking for Edward Thorps analysis of craps, and no more obsession.  I quit.  Yeah, I think I can quit.
