Happy Holidays!  Did you have a fun Christmas and New Year's?  My family and I made ginger bread houses, visited my family in Chicago, where we were entertained at the Apollo chilren's theatre, almost completed a game night and scavenger hunt downtown, photographed the tail end of a protest, enjoyed a train ride, and celebrated Christmas.  Now we are all geared up for a productive 2016.
