Introspection: the examination or observation of one's own mental and emotional processes
*New Oxford American Dictionary*

I am living in Bloomington, Indiana out having drinks with friends and somehow I mentioned that I would start a blog titled Introspective Ivan about (I think) sex, politics, relationships.  So here I am typing now.

The subjects will vary, and I will be introspective sometimes, and I will write once a week.
