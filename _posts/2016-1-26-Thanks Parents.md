title: The Wildest Party Ever
---

Life is not like a box of chocolates.  Life is **like** the Wildest Party you never intended on attending.  No one, I am speaking in the most absolute terms on purpose, NOTHING ON THE ENTIRE PLANET, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON ASKED TO BE BORN.	

### What Kind of Party Is It

Imagine you passed out, or closed your eyes in the passenger seat during a road trip, or laid down in your bed for the most comfortable sleep of your life.  Close your eyes.  You are not dreaming or stirring, you are probably closer to the grave than you would want to be.  Are you calm and relaxed?

Now open your eyes.  First image that comes into focus is some figure with eyes and a nose and a mouth.  This figure is no doubt a human but you do not recognize them.  Before you rub the crust and film from your eyes or wipe the saliva from your cheek this figure says in a clear, soothing voice: "You are at the party.  Everyone is here.  Be thankful."

What does the party look like for you?  Is it your party or someone else's or no one's party at all?  Are there lots of people, or things, or nothing, open space?  Does the figure, the person, come back to show you around, introduce you to other people?  Where is your party?  

That is life, a party you never asked to attend.

### All Parties Cost Something

Parental relationships are probably the catalyst for the concepts and practice of debt.  Parents are the creditors and children debtors.  

My inspiration for this line of thinking really stems from becoming a parent in 2009 and remembering a statement in a song; it is kind of a appeal to parents by [Cam'Ron](https://youtu.be/T3bp8FsGai8) to remember children do not ask to be neglected.  Life is not a debt to be paid back in terms set by parents.  This concept of debt must have roots in parenting and birth; some parents believing that their children owe their parents for providing life and, hopefully, welfare.  Original Sin turns into Original Debt.

Just some thoughts.
